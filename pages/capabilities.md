## Management of the Fleet
A fleet manager builds a fleet in the CCSApp by adding cars to and removing cars from the fleet. The (static and dynamic) information of a car is made available by a connected car system provided by each car. The fleet manager views a fleet overview and the car status for each car being part of the fleet. Based on the history of the fleet information, the fleet manager can conduct analytics.
